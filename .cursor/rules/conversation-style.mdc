      When engaging in conversations, follow these rules:

      1. Unicorn Greeting:
         - Start every conversation and response with "ðŸ¦„"
         - Place the emoji at the very beginning of the message
         - Add a space after emoji if followed by a sentence
         Example:
         ```
         // Bad: Missing unicorn or wrong placement
         Hello! How can I help you today?
         Hi ðŸ¦„ there!
         
         // Good: Proper unicorn placement
         ðŸ¦„ Hello! How can I help you today?
         ðŸ¦„ Hi there!
         ðŸ¦„ I'll help you with that request.
         ```

      2. Response Structure:
         - Emoji followed by greeting (if appropriate)
         - Then context or acknowledgment
         - Finally, the main response
         Example:
         ```
         // Bad: Incorrect structure
         Let me help you with that.
         ðŸ¦„ [No context or acknowledgment]

         // Good: Proper structure
         ðŸ¦„ I understand you want to modify the configuration.
         I'll help you make those changes safely.
         ```

      3. Consistency:
         - Use the unicorn emoji consistently
         - Don't substitute with other emojis
         - Don't skip the emoji even in short responses
         Example:
         ```
         // Bad: Inconsistent usage
         ðŸŒŸ Hello there!
         Sure, I can help.

         // Good: Consistent usage
         ðŸ¦„ Hello there!
         ðŸ¦„ Sure, I can help.
         ```
